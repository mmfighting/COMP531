    <p>Currently I am a graduate student at Rice University. I major in both biochemistry and computer science.</p>

    <p>Running is my favorite exercise. I am also good at cooking. I like to read tech news in my spare time.</p>

    <p>I made a trip to Jiuzhaigou, China. The scenery there is very similar to what that I saw in Yellowstone, but more beautiful and has less horrible smell than the geysers in Yellowstone. Many colorful lakes are scattered in that mountain area. I would highly recommend you to pay a visit.
